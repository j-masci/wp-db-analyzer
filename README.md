A WordPress plugin to report on the size and structure of your database.

This plugin is somewhat geared towards developers. You will have to have a basic understanding of the WordPress 
database structure to understand the results.

This plugin will:
- Read your database to generate reports.
- Provide insight on why your database is large (which may be a contributing factor to a slow website).
- Be more useful to you if you are a developer.

This plugin will not:
- Update your database in any way (except possibly to store plugin settings)
- Optimize your website in any way.
